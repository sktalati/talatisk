
So for this program as commented in the program as well we were to blast two files to obtain a blast output and find the homologs where we needed to 
take the mouseRefSeq IDs and extract only those from our blast output. My logic here was as mentioned in the comments, was to only obtain a 
custom blast output to make the parsing a little bit easier. 

The blast commands that was used in the program:

1) makeblastdb -in human.rna.fna -dbtype nucl -out humandb.db
2) blastn -db humandb.db -query mouse.rna.fna -outfmt "6 qseqid sseqid qlen slen length bitscore evalue" -evalue 1e-05 -out blast_output.txt
